# Audio Chunking and silence Removal Pipeline

## Overview
This script processes an audio file by removing silence, splitting it into meaningful chunks, and ensuring each chunk does not exceed a predefined maximum duration. It is particularly useful for speech processing applications, where silence removal and chunking can improve transcription accuracy and processing efficiency.

## Pipeline Workflow
The audio chunking process follows these steps:

1. **Load Audio**: The script loads an audio file from a given path.
2. **Detect and Remove Silence**: The script detects and removes silence based on configurable thresholds.
3. **Chunk Processing**: The detected chunks are merged or split to ensure they adhere to the maximum allowed chunk duration.
4. **Save Processed Chunks**: The processed chunks are saved as separate audio files in a specified output directory.
5. **Combine Chunks (Optional)**: The script can combine all processed chunks into a single file.

## Configurable Parameters
The script allows customization through the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `MIN_SILENCE_LEN` | Minimum silence duration (in milliseconds) that will be treated as silence. **Example**: If set to `1000`, any silence shorter than 1 second will not be considered. |
| `SILENCE_THRESH` | Defines the loudness level (in decibels) below which audio is considered silent. **Example**: If set to `-60`, audio quieter than -60dB will be detected as silence. Lower values make the detection more sensitive to quiet sounds. |
| `KEEP_SILENCE` | Amount of silence (in milliseconds) to retain at the start and end of each chunk. **Example**: If set to `800`, the script will keep 0.8 seconds of silence to preserve natural pauses. |
| `SEEK_STEP` | Step size (in milliseconds) for scanning silence. **Example**: If set to `2`, the script will check every 2ms for silence instead of checking every single millisecond, improving performance. |
| `MAX_CHUNK_LENGTH` | Maximum allowed duration of a chunk (in seconds). **Example**: If set to `180`, no chunk will exceed 3 minutes in length. If a chunk is too long, it will be split accordingly. |

## Pros and Cons of This Method

### Pros:
- **Improves Speech Recognition Accuracy**: Removing silence and segmenting audio helps speech recognition models process data more efficiently.
- **Optimized Storage and Processing**: Splitting audio into manageable chunks reduces computational load.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Parameters can be adjusted to fit different types of audio content.
- **Preserves Natural Pauses**: By keeping a portion of silence, the method ensures better continuity between chunks.
- **Efficient for Long Audio Files**: Helps in breaking down long recordings into smaller, more processable parts.

### Cons:
- **Potential Loss of Context**: If not tuned properly, chunks may cut off words, affecting transcription accuracy.
- **Inconsistent Chunk Lengths**: Due to variable silence lengths, chunk sizes may vary significantly.
- **Higher Computational Cost**: Silence detection and chunk processing require additional processing power.
- **Noise Sensitivity**: If the silence threshold is too low, background noise might be misclassified as speech, leading to inaccurate chunking.

## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   python silence_removal_strict.py
   ```

3. **Output Files**:
   - Processed chunks will be saved in the `chunks/` directory.
   - The combined audio file (if enabled) will be saved as `combined_audio.wav`.

## Conclusion
This script provides an automated approach to process audio files efficiently by removing unnecessary silence and segmenting them into meaningful chunks for further processing. It is particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition, transcription, and machine learning preprocessing.
